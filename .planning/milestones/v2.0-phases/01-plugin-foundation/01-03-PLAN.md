<objective>
Create the remaining four skill files: wp-patterns (Domain 5), accessibility (Domain 6), testing framework, and reporting/communication style.

Purpose: Completes the skill extraction from the original CLAUDE.md. After this plan, all diagnostic knowledge lives in skills/ and none remains in CLAUDE.md.
Output: 4 skill files completing the full set of 8 skills.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create wp-patterns and accessibility skills</name>
  <files>skills/wp-patterns/SKILL.md, skills/accessibility/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the original CLAUDE.md for Domain 5 and Domain 6 content. Create skill files with full content transfer.

**skills/wp-patterns/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: `name: wp-patterns`, `description: Reviews WordPress architecture patterns including theme structure, plugin design, data modeling, and integration patterns. Use when evaluating custom themes/plugins architecture, data model choices, or integration design.`
- Content: ALL of Domain 5 (sections 5.1 through 5.4). This includes Theme Architecture, Plugin Architecture, Data Architecture, and Integration Architecture.
- Also include the WP-CLI diagnostic commands from the "Tool Usage > WordPress CLI Diagnostics" section (core verify-checksums, plugin list, cron inspection, database optimization, transient cleanup, rewrite rules).

**skills/accessibility/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: `name: accessibility`, `description: Evaluates WordPress sites against WCAG compliance and data privacy requirements. Use when auditing accessibility, reviewing GDPR compliance, or checking privacy implementations.`
- Content: ALL of Domain 6 (sections 6.1 through 6.2). This includes WCAG Compliance and Data Privacy.

Each skill file should be self-contained with complete domain knowledge.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. wp-patterns SKILL.md has frontmatter with name "wp-patterns" and description
2. wp-patterns contains "Theme Architecture", "Plugin Architecture", "Data Architecture", "dbDelta()", "wp_remote_get"
3. accessibility SKILL.md has frontmatter with name "accessibility" and description
4. accessibility contains "WCAG", "heading hierarchy", "GDPR", "cookie consent"
  </verify>
  <done>wp-patterns skill covers all WordPress architecture review knowledge. Accessibility skill covers WCAG and data privacy compliance.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create testing and reporting skills</name>
  <files>skills/testing/SKILL.md, skills/reporting/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the original CLAUDE.md for the Testing Framework section and the Communication Style / Action Logging / Reporting sections. Create skill files with full content transfer.

**skills/testing/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: `name: testing`, `description: Guides WordPress testing strategy including PHPUnit with WP_UnitTestCase, test categories, coverage targets, and test design principles. Use when writing tests, setting up test infrastructure, or reviewing test coverage.`
- Content: The ENTIRE "Testing Framework" section from the original CLAUDE.md. This includes:
  - Unit Testing Strategy
  - Test Coverage Targets (Critical paths: 100%, Business logic: 95%+, etc.)
  - Test Categories (the full tests/ directory structure with unit/, integration/, security/, performance/, e2e/)
  - Test Design Principles (Arrange-Act-Assert, data providers, factory methods, etc.)
  - Iterative Test Review Process
  - Configuration Files (phpunit.xml.dist example)

**skills/reporting/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: `name: reporting`, `description: Structures diagnostic findings for both technical and non-technical audiences with severity ratings, evidence-based reporting, and action logging. Use when generating reports, communicating findings, or logging diagnostic actions.`
- Content: Extract and combine these sections from the original CLAUDE.md:
  - "Communication Style" section (both non-technical and technical user examples)
  - "Severity Definitions" table (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational with criteria and response times)
  - "Action Logging & Reporting" section (action log format, phase reports structure)
  - "File Organization for Deliverables" section (the session directory structure)
  - "Input Materials" table (what can be analyzed)
  - The "Self-Generated Validation" subsection (write test scripts, create DB queries, etc.)
  - "Versioning & Changelog" section (semantic versioning, changelog format)

The reporting skill is the largest skill because it combines communication style (per user decision: "Communication style goes in a reporting skill, not CLAUDE.md") with the structured reporting methodology.

  <verify>
1. testing SKILL.md has frontmatter with name "testing" and description

5. reporting contains the communication style examples (the "missing nonce verification" before/after example)

  <done>Testing skill provides complete test infrastructure guidance. Reporting skill combines communication style, severity definitions, action logging, and report formats into a single reference for generating diagnostic output.</done>

1. All four skill files exist: skills/wp-patterns/SKILL.md, skills/accessibility/SKILL.md, skills/testing/SKILL.md, skills/reporting/SKILL.md
2. Each has valid YAML frontmatter with name and description fields
3. Combined with Plan 02's four skills, the full set of 8 skills covers everything from the original CLAUDE.md
4. `grep -r "WP_UnitTestCase" skills/` finds it in testing skill
5. `grep -r "WCAG" skills/` finds it in accessibility skill
6. `grep -r "Severity" skills/` finds it in reporting skill

<success_criteria>
- All eight skills directory exists with SKILL.md files (4 from Plan 02 + 4 from this plan)
- Every section of the original CLAUDE.md's diagnostic content has been transferred to a skill
- Each skill is self-contained with proper frontmatter for Claude auto-selection
- Testing skill per user decision: "Testing framework knowledge included as skills/testing/SKILL.md"
- Reporting skill per user decision: "Communication style goes in a reporting skill, not CLAUDE.md"
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-plugin-foundation/01-03-SUMMARY.md`
