# Milestone v2.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v2.0 — Database, Performance & Multi-Source Access
**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** TECH DEBT (all requirements met, accumulated documentation/wiring debt)

## Requirements Coverage

**Score: 25/25 v2 requirements satisfied**

All v2 requirements (MSRC-01 through BTCH-02) confirmed implemented and cross-phase wired by integration checker. MSRC-06 checkbox was unchecked in REQUIREMENTS.md but functionality is confirmed present in /diagnose Section 4 (WP_CLI_SKILLS gating).

| Requirement | Phase | Verification Source | Status |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| MSRC-01 | Phase 5 | 05-02-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| MSRC-02 | Phase 5 | 05-02-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| MSRC-03 | Phase 5 | 05-01-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| MSRC-04 | Phase 5 | 05-01-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| MSRC-05 | Phase 5 | 05-01-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| MSRC-06 | Phase 5 | integration checker (WIRED) | satisfied (checkbox not updated) |
| MSRC-07 | Phase 5 | 05-01-SUMMARY + integration | satisfied |
| DBHL-01 | Phase 6 | 06-VERIFICATION | satisfied |
| DBHL-02 | Phase 6 | 06-VERIFICATION | satisfied |

| BTCH-01 | Phase 8 | 08-VERIFICATION | satisfied |
| BTCH-02 | Phase 8 | 08-VERIFICATION | satisfied |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Phase 5 | Missing | Unverified (paperwork) | Functionality confirmed by integration checker — all 7 MSRC requirements wired |
| Phase 6 | 06-VERIFICATION.md | Passed (12/12) | All DB health and infrastructure skills verified |
| Phase 7 | 07-VERIFICATION.md | Passed (5/5) | All performance and architecture skills verified |
| Phase 8 | 08-VERIFICATION.md | Passed (5/5) | Trend tracker and batch command verified |

## Integration Check Results

**Connected:** 22 cross-phase wiring paths confirmed
**Orphaned:** 0 exports unused
**Missing:** 4 documentation gaps (no runtime impact)

### Functional Issue

**BROKEN-01: skill_coverage variable name mismatch** (Medium)

- `/diagnose` Section 5.5 computes `SKILLS_COMPLETED_COUNT` and `SKILLS_TOTAL_COUNT` but trend-tracker expects `SKILLS_COMPLETED` and `SKILLS_TOTAL` as scalar values
- Effect: `skill_coverage` field in trends.json renders incorrectly; /batch coverage footnotes inherit wrong value
- Fix: Add two assignment lines before trend-tracker invocation in /diagnose Section 5.5
- Affected: TRND-03 (trends.json schema), BTCH-02 (comparison matrix footnotes)

### Documentation Gaps

1. **MISSING-01:** plugin.json skills manifest missing 11 skills from Phases 6-8 (no runtime impact)
2. **MISSING-02:** plugin.json diagnose description missing "performance" mode
3. **MISSING-03:** /status Available Commands footer missing "performance" in diagnose modes

## E2E Flow Trace

`/connect → /diagnose → trend-tracker → /batch → comparison matrix`

All steps confirmed wired. Only `skill_coverage` display is affected by BROKEN-01 — grades, counts, and sorting all function correctly.

## Tech Debt Summary

| Item | Phase | Severity | Runtime Impact |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Missing 05-VERIFICATION.md | Phase 5 | Low | None |
| MSRC-06 checkbox not updated | Phase 5 | Low | None |
| skill_coverage variable mismatch | Phase 8 | Medium | Incorrect display |
| plugin.json skills manifest incomplete | Phases 6-8 | Low | None |
| plugin.json diagnose description | Phase 7 | Low | None |
| /status performance mode hint | Phase 7 | Low | None |

**Total: 6 items across 3 phases. 1 medium (functional display bug), 5 low (documentation).**
